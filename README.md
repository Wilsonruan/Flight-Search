## Flight Search - [flYjet](https://wilsonruan.github.io/Flight-Search/)

[https://wilsonruan.github.io/Flight-Search/]
Our project, flYjet, shows all flight options in one place, creating a simple alternative to the confusing sites. It is a simple, easy to use application where a user can search for flights according to their starting point/destination and whether the user is travelling one-way or both ways. flYjet will find the best possible match and provide the user with an option to choose from. Flight prices, distances between source/destination, and travel durations are provided to the user. 

## Motivation
As a group with passion to travel all around the world and a lot of experiences travelling many countries, we understood the difficulty of choosing the best flight option. Also, not knowing which currency the website uses, we were charged extra when the flight was purchased in USD. Our project, flYjet, was designed to resolve all these issues and provide travellers with the best experience.
